                <h2>Hello, I'm Favour Williams!</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>This is a simple website about me and my tech journey! I'm a Cybersecurity analyst and presently an intern in the Genesys Upskill 2025 cohort but first journey with me through my tech journey
                    <p>
                       My journey into tech began shortly after secondary school. 
                       At the time, I didn’t fully understand what technology had to offer, but something sparked during computer lessons I took while preparing for JAMB. That spark quickly turned into a flame. I found myself exploring on my own, learning through trial, error, and endless curiosity  all without formal training.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>I was particularly drawn to cybersecurity. The idea of protecting systems and understanding the “why” behind digital vulnerabilities fascinated me. But the path wasn’t easy. As a young woman in a space still seen by many as “unusual” for someone like me, I often felt out of place. People questioned my interest, dismissed my dreams, and made me feel like I didn’t belong.I also faced the challenge of not having a laptop for practicals. I had to rely on borrowed devices, which made learning even more challenging. But I refused to let these obstacles define me.</p>
                    <p>Despite the challenges, I persevered. I immersed myself in online courses, joined communities, and sought mentorship from those who believed in my potential. I learned to code, understand networks, and analyze security threats. Each step was a victory, each challenge a lesson.</p>
                    <p>Today, I’m proud to say that I’m not just a cybersecurity analyst; I’m a testament to the power of resilience and determination. My journey has taught me that passion can overcome any obstacle, and that every setback is an opportunity for growth.</p>
                    <p>What changed everything was finding a community people who shared my passion, encouraged my growth, and reminded me that tech isn’t limited by gender, only by mindset. That support pushed me forward.Today, I’m proud to say I’m an entry-level front-end web developer, currently learning and growing in the Genesys Upskill 2025 cohort — an opportunity I found through a friend who had once walked the same path in Genesys Learnable 2025.
                    <p>That's my story, a journey of resilience, passion, and the belief that anyone can carve their own path in tech, regardless of the challenges they face. I hope it inspires others to pursue their dreams. So lets hear all about your tech journey, too!</p>
